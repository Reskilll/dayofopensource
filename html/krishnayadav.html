            <h4>Why do you like open source?</h4>
            
            <p>
                When I was in my 1st grade, my father had introduced me to computers. It was just an athlon processor with very weak clock speeds but I was fascinated by how I could do so many various tasks such as watching cartoons (yeah heh), playing games, doing calculations without using my brain and many more. When I grew up, I was almost familiar with most of the ways on how to use windows and such stuff. I liked how I could just write some lines of code and make the hardware perform tasks as per my wish. This made me curious and I asked some bhaiyas who were doing CS in colleges and they told me that I should start off with open-source. I asked why is that so and they replied that in open source, you get to learn from various developers from all over the world who can help you in your code and in addition to that, even you can help someone else if you are capable/expert in some field that the other person might not be. That feeling of being appreciated by others is one that you would always love alot.
              
              So yeah, this is the way how I got into the world of open-source :)
